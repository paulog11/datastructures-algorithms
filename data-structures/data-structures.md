## Linked List
### Just like an array, Linked Lists store linear data of similar types. Arrays have some problems though:
### Their sizes are fixed, and inserting a new element is expensive because the sizes are fixed.
###
### Linked List Advantages over Arrays:
### 1) Dynamic Size
### 2) Ease of insertion/deletion
### Drawbacks:
### 1) Random access is not allowed. We always have to start access from the first node.
### 2) Extra memory space is required for a pointer for each element of the list.
